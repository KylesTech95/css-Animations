# css-Animations
Random Css Animations for review, edit, education etc...

The purpose of this project is to successfully manipulate different elements of the attached SVG file. Althought the index.html has css included, I have a css only file within the repository. In addition, comments are added to the CSS. 

Enjoy! :)
